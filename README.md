# ColorTimer

The code for the color indicating remaining time on clock is from Sebastian Saunier:

The Pomodoro is a productivity technique that allows you to work for 25 mins and take a break for 5.  Some things I changed were the ability to see the countdown, some color queues and allwing user to change the Pomodoro length up or down with the click of a button.
